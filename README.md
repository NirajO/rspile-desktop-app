Pile Analysis Desktop Application

This is a Python-based desktop application designed to assist civil and geotechnical engineers in performing axial and lateral pile analysis. The application focuses on clarity, usability, and visualization to help users better understand pile behavior under different loading conditions.

This project was developed as a senior design capstone and demonstrates the integration of engineering concepts with professional software development practices.

FEATURES

• Axial pile analysis for compression and tension
• Lateral pile analysis including load–deflection behavior
• Interactive graphical visualization of results
• User-friendly desktop interface
• Customizable pile and soil parameters

TECHNOLOGIES USED

• Python
• PySide6 (Qt for Python)
• NumPy
• Matplotlib
• PyInstaller
